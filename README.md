# TI-99/4A 64K Cartridge Board

## Background
This is the original 64K EPROM Cartridge board for TI-99/4A from www.hexbus.com.  I designed it around 2010.  You may also see people refer to this as the "Guidry" board.  Almost all TI cartridge boards that are ROM boards are derived from this in one way or another. 

* This 64K uses inverted 8K banks to bank switch with a 27512 (i.e. Bank 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0 should be placed in that order on the EPROM).
* To have a non-inverted image work with this board, invert the order of the 8K chunks (i.e. >0000->1FFF goes to >7000->7FFF on the EPROM.)  There are [utilities](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/350614-rom-cartridge-with-multiple-banks/?do=findComment&comment=5271188) written to perform inversion, or you can do so manually by cutting and pasting in a hex editor.

## Original README
This 64K .pcb file was made with ExpressPCB (www.expresspcb.com).

The Gerbers.zip file is also included with this file, and was generated by ExpressPCB.

The gerber files are formatted as RS-274-X files.  The drill file includes the hole size definitions.  The diameters listed refer to the finished hole sizes after plating, not the drill size.

Each file can be identify by it's extension:

* .SLK = top silkscreen layer  
* .SMT = top solder mask layer 
* .TOP = top copper layer
* .BOT = bottom copper layer
* .SMB = bottom solder mask layer
* .DRI = drill file
* .OLN = board outline

You can use a Gerber file previewer to look at these files.  There are many free previewers are available for downloading from the web.

You can use and make changes to these files as long as the copyright notices remain intact on the board files and this file is distributed with it.  

This file is (c) 2009 www.hexbus.com, (c) 2007 www.ti-994a.com. Thanks to www.mainbyte.com for the idea to make this.  Thanks to James Fetzner and Mike Brent for assistance when designing it.

If you make any changes and would like to share them with me, I would love to see this board continue to improve and become something more....
