# TI-99/4A 64K Cartridge Board

## Background
This is the original 64K EPROM Cartridge board for TI-99/4A from www.hexbus.com.

## Original README
This 64K .pcb file was made with ExpressPCB (www.expresspcb.com).

The Gerbers.zip file is also included with this file, and was generated by ExpressPCB.

The gerber files are formatted as RS-274-X files.  The drill file includes the hole size definitions.  The diameters listed refer to the finished hole sizes after plating, not the drill size.

Each file can be identify by it's extension:

   .SLK = top silkscreen layer
   
   .SMT = top solder mask layer
   
   .TOP = top copper layer
   
   .BOT = bottom copper layer
   
   .SMB = bottom solder mask layer
   
   .DRI = drill file
   
   .OLN = board outline

You can use a Gerber file previewer to look at these files.  Two free previewers are available for downloading from the web.

GraphiCode's "GC-Prevue" can be downloaded at:

Lavenir's "ViewMate" can be downloaded at:

You can use and make changes to these files as long as the copyright notices remain intact on the board files and this file is distributed 
with it.  

This file is (c) 2009 www.hexbus.com, (c) 2007 www.ti-994a.com. Thanks to www.mainbyte.com for the idea to make this.

If you make any changes and would like to share them with me, I would love to see this board continue to improve and become something more....
