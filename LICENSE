**Additional Attribution Requirement**

When producing physical reproductions or derivative versions of the cartridge board design, the following silkscreen attribution strings must be substantially retained **on the board itself**. They do **not** need to be included in any other documentation, software, or materials derived from the board's usage:

- "www.hexbus.com - 64K (c) 2009 jdg"  
- "8K version (c) 2007 C. Randolph"  
- "Original concept www.mainbyte.com"  
- "Special thanks to S. Connor and M. Brent"

These strings may be combined or reformatted as needed, so long as the original meaning and credit remain clear. Do not remove, obscure, or misrepresent the origin or contributors of the design.
